# TOA-ContextFreeGrammer-Python
# Context-Free Grammar (CFG) — Theory of Automata

# Overview
This project presents the design of a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) for a Python-like programming language. The work was completed during my BSCS (5th Semester) under the guidance of Resource Person Mian Ahmed Shafiq.

# Features Covered
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Decision making (if–else)
- Nested conditions
- Loop constructs (for, while, do-while, foreach)
- Nested loops
- Arrays
- User-defined functions

# Concepts Demonstrated
- Theory of Automata
- Formal Languages
- Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
